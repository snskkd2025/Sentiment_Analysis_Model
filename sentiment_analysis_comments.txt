positive:
This ergonomic mouse is fantastic! It relieved my wrist pain almost immediately, and the wireless connection is seamless. The scroll wheel is also very precise, which is great for design work. My only minor gripe is that the battery life could be a bit longer, but it's a small trade-off for the comfort.

i purchased a product from this manufacturer, but it was poorly designed and didn't work properly. i'm disappointed in the lack of quality
